# Fraud Detection in Python

## Adapted from a [Datacamp course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/fraud-detection-in-python)

In this project, fighting fraud by using data is demonstrated. Supervised learning algorithms are used to detect fraudulent behavior similar to past ones, and unsupervised learning methods are used to discover new types of fraud activities. Finally, text mining and topic modeling are used to detect fraudulent behavior.
